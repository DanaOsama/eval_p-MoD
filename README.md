# Integration of p-MoD into PaliGemma

This work aims to evaluate the performance of the p-MoD method [1] on the PaliGemma model [2]. The choice of model is made because of the presence of different resolutions in the vision encoder of PaliGemma, which makes it easy to evaluate how well p-MoD is performing when being used on a higher resolution model versus on a model with a lower resolution.
